# Python-URL-Shortener-App

This is a URL shortener application I made with Python using the "Tkinter" import.

The application has only one function that is contained within the button "Shorten URL" which allows the URL that is inserted into the first (top) input bar to be shortened into a tinyurl paste.
The window of the app is not resizeable due to the fact it would be only problematic as elements of the application would be incorrectly spread around if the app's default size 500x500 was changed.

Two conditions that are applied to the application function; 
- There must be data within the boxes before the button is pressed, if there is no data present an error prompt will appear.
- If the data inputted is not a valid URL an error message will also be prompted.

alpha_url = This refers to the URL found in the top box (Non-Shortened)

beta_url = This refers to the URL that is created in the bottom box (Shortened)
